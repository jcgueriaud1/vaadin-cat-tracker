# Vaadin Silly project - Cat Tracker
This application uses the camera of your laptop or phone and detector if there is a person, cat or dog.<br/>
If it detects one of this element, it will play a sound and enable the right button.<br/>
It's using Tensor flow to detect the "object". You can check this [tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-object-detection/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) if you want to see more.

## How to use the smartest silly app

To use the cat tracker, you need a computer with a camera or a smartphone (because Vaadin is so cool that it can run on a tablet, smartphone or computer :)).

Now you need a cat and if the camera detects a cat then the application will say Hello (in a cat language).

The application is also working with a dog and will say Hello to your dog (it has been translated to a dog language :) ).

Disclaimer: No animals were harmed during the making of the application.
